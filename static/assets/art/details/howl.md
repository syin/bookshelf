This year, I started learning how to draw*.

<aside>* Technically, relearning how to draw? I used to take art lessons and all but I haven't really drawn since I was a kid.</aside>

I used the following image from [Howl's Moving Castle](https://pics.me.me/war-bad-selfish-pursuit-5-and-beauty-is-a-3-43029696.png) as a reference:

Experimenting with mixing skin tones and avoiding [hard edges](https://www.craftsy.com/post/hard-watercolor-edges/)**.

<aside>** Yes, many of these swatches look jaundiced. I ended up "fixing" the hard edges by feathering them out with a brush with no paint and a bit of water.</aside>

I also bought a [masking fluid](https://store.opusartsupplies.com/sagro/storefront/store.php?mode=showproductdetail&product=8916) and [white gel pen](https://store.opusartsupplies.com/sagro/storefront/store.php?mode=browsecategory&category=5301), which really help with fine details and avoiding the messy/blurry look that my paintings otherwise have. They also really help keep the whites of the eyes bright and crisp.
