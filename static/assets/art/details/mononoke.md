The reference I used is really beautiful, and I wasn't really able to capture the depth/perspective of the forest. (I don't understand lighting and shading very well yet.) My leaves are also relatively uniform in size, even though the bushes and trees in the distance should have smaller and less detailed leaves. I struggled with the wolf fur shading a lot, and ended up erasing* and repainting it a few times.

<aside>* Re-wetting the paint using a brush with only water, and blotting off the paint. After doing this a few times it felt like the paper was degrading, so I had to settle with what I had.</aside>

I haven't drawn in a few months (it is November 14 as I write this). What's next? I'm not sure. I've been drawing from illustrated references so far because it is easier to understand how proportions and depth work when referencing a 2d image (compared to a photograph, where your brain has to map the 3d space onto a 2d illustration). I've greatly enjoyed this process, despite all my criticism and complaining. I'd like to learn about pixel art or cityscapes but it feels daunting.
