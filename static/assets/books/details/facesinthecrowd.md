I read this as part of the Life's Library book club.[^1]

- Initial thoughts: Really enjoying the prose style, the descriptive passages, and the overall moody and melancholic tone.
- Descriptions of the city (NYC?) and moments of quiet solitude and mundane routines
- themes of memory and impermanence; thinking of her past as ghosts? ("But Moby exists. Or perhaps not. But he existed then.")
- quirks or strangeness of characters? that I usually suspend disbelief and accept. in this case, her lying ("I did [x]. or maybe I didn't.") and stealing small things

I liked the prose and vignette style, and the overall moody and melancholy tone. The descriptions of city life (NYC? I wasn't completely sure) and routines and solitude really appeal to me, even knowing that this is often romanticized and even a trope (especially in writing/art about NYC).

As Ketie Holmes and Hannah said earlier, it's not clear what is "fictional" but I think that beyond thinking about the specific events in the novel, the thoughts and feelings of the protagonist surely must resonate with the author beyond putting herself in the shoes of a character? And in a slice-of-life book like this, those might be more "important" or "real" than any of the narrative events.

Another thing that stood out to me is how she thinks about memory and impermanence, and her frequent mention of ghosts, the dead, cemeteries, etc. ("But Moby exists. Or perhaps not. But he existed then.", "I told him I was leaving the city for good because Iâ€™d become a ghost".) It also seems like the act of writing itself can be both invocative of both memory and ghosts: "I only manage to emulate my ghosts, write the way they used to speak" (I can't really articulate my thoughts here)


[^1]: being in a remote book club has been nice! I like being able to read and discuss asynchronously, at my own pace.
